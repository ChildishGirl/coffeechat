# Coffee Chat

List of awesome people offering their time **for free** to have a "coffee chat" with others about different topics, mostly in a mentorship kind of way.

## Add yourself to this list

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information. Note that having your name listed here will probably help you get coffee chats scheduled, but nothing is guaranteed, so the best way will always be for you to promote your coffee chats within your network and on social media.

## Acknowledgements

The idea of a coffee chat resource list is coming from [Julien Lengrand-Lambert.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julienlengrand/).
